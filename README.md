# FletMusicPlayer
A music player with python and flet.

About this project:
  I created this project in junior high school, but due to limited technology, it was not completed, and now I feel that this project is open source to get everyone's help, the current code is the first version, it is very messy, I will complete the rewriting of the project as soon as possible to improve readability.
  我在初中时创建了这个项目，但由于技术有限，没有完成，现在觉定将此项目开源，来获得大家的帮助，目前的代码是第一版，很乱，我将尽快完成项目的重写，提高可读性。

Feature:
  I expect to divide this project into three parts, the local version, the network version, and finally the integration, and the current main thing is to complete the development of the local version first.
  我预期将此项目分为三部分，local版，network版，最后再进行整合，目前主要是先完成local版的开发。

注/concentrate：
  Since I am now a freshman in high school, I don't have enough time, so the progress will be slower and I will get rid of everyone.
  由于本人现在是高一新生，时间不是很充裕，所以进度会比较慢，也摆脱大家了。
